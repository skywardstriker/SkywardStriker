<h1 class="early-head">Early days</h1>

<p class="early-paragraph">I started my YouTube channel in 2017. I had one of those cheap $20 capture cards, and was super excited. Problem was, it only recorded for about 10 minutes at a time before stopping. My strategy was that I would record for ten minutes and then stop, and eventually put them all together into one video. The second problem was that it couldn't record sound. So I would use my phone and record my voice.</p>

<p class="early-paragraph">As all of that came together, I would make a good amount of videos to possibly put on the channel. I ended up scratching most of them, but some made it on. They got a good amount of views for being a new channel, so I was happy. </p>
